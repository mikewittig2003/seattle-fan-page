        <h2>Seattle Mariners History</h2>
        <p>The Seattle Mariners are a professional baseball team based in Seattle, Washington. They were established in
            1977 as an expansion team in Major League Baseball (MLB) and are part of the American League (AL) West
            division. The Mariners play their home games at T-Mobile Park, which opened in 1999 as Safeco Field.</p>

        <h3>Early Years and Struggles</h3>
        <p>The team's first years were marked by struggles on the field, with the Mariners not posting a winning record
            until 1991. They experienced their first real success in the mid-1990s, led by outstanding players such as
            Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Martinez, and Randy Johnson.</p>

        <h3>The 1995 Season and "Refuse to Lose"</h3>
        <p>In 1995, the Mariners achieved their first-ever playoff appearance, winning the AL West in dramatic fashion
            by defeating the California Angels in a one-game tiebreaker. The team's exciting playoff run, which included
            an unforgettable AL Division Series victory over the New York Yankees, was characterized by the motto
            "Refuse to Lose." This season is widely regarded as a turning point for the franchise, as it helped secure
            support for a new stadium and generated greater fan interest.</p>

        <h3>Record-Setting 2001 Season</h3>
        <p>In 2001, the Mariners enjoyed their most successful regular season in franchise history, winning an
            MLB-record-tying 116 games under manager Lou Piniella. However, the team was unable to translate its
            regular-season dominance into postseason success, losing to the Yankees in the AL Championship Series.</p>

        <h3>Playoff Drought and Recent Success</h3>
        <p>Following their 2001 season, the Mariners experienced a lengthy playoff drought, failing to make the
            postseason until 2022. During this period, the team underwent several roster changes and rebuilds. However,
            with the emergence of talented young players and key acquisitions, the Mariners returned to the playoffs in
            2022, rejuvenating the fanbase and providing hope for future success.</p>

        <h3>Notable Players</h3>
        <p>Throughout their history, the Mariners have had many great players wear their uniform, including Hall of
            Famers Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Martinez, and Randy Johnson. Other notable players include Ichiro Suzuki,
            Félix Hernández, Alex Rodriguez, and Jay Buhner.</p>
