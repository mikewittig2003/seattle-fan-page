            <p>The Seattle Mariners were established in 1977 as an expansion team in Major League Baseball. They play
                their home games at T-Mobile Park in Seattle, Washington. The Mariners struggled for many years, but in
                2022 the team finally snapped its playoff drought, making the playoffs for the first time since 2001.
                The Mariners have had many great players throughout their history, including Hall of Famers Ken Griffey
                Jr. and Edgar Martinez.</p>
